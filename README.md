# SoftwareCPU

Discription:
This project is me getting bored and trying to create a CPU in software (C/C++) from memory.
All knowledge that i use in this project is pulled from what I remember of my computer architecture classes. Meaning that pretty much everything in the project is most likely going to be poorly designed.

IDE will be Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, written in C/C++.
